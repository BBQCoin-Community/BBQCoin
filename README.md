# **What is BBQCoin?**
BBQCoin (BQC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed for fast and secure peer-to-peer transactions. Initially launched in 2012, BBQCoin has been revived and updated with new features to ensure long-term scalability and community-driven growth.

**Reinstating the original blockchain**:
   - Reversed the chain back to block height `490,843` to address high circulation supply issues caused by minimal mining activity between 2012 and 2024.
   - Created block `490,845` with a special reward of `351,582 BQC` to reimburse miners who revived the chain during early 2024.
